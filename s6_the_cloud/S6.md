# Cloud computing
Running computations locally is often sufficient when only playing around with code in initial phase of 
development. However, to really scale your experiments you will need more computing power than what your
standard laptop/desktop can offer. You probably already have experience with running on a local cluster
or similar but todays topic is about utilizing cloud computing.

There exist a [numerous](https://github.com/zszazi/Deep-learning-in-cloud) amount of cloud compute providers 
with some of the biggest being:
* Azure
* AWS
* Alibaba cloud
* Google Cloud

The all have slight advantages and disadvantages over each others. In this course we are going to focus on Google cloud, because they have been kindly enough to sponsor $50 of cloud credit to each student. If you happen to run out of credit, you can also get some free credit for a limited amount of time when you signup with a new account.

Todays exercises are about getting to know how to work with the cloud. If you are in doubt about anything or want to deep
dive into some topics, I can recommend watching this [series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D3X6Xl5c_Y&list=PLIivdWyY5sqKh1gDR0WpP9iIOY00IE0xL) or going through the [general docs](https://cloud.google.com/docs).
