The continues X we have looked at until now is what we can consider "classical" continues integration. We are now gonna change gear and look at **continues machine learning**. As the name may suggest we are now focusing on automatizing actual machine learning processes (compared to automatizing unit testing). The automatization we are going to look at here is reporting of model performance whenever we push changes to our github reposatory.

We are going to use `cml` by [iterative.ai](https://iterative.ai/) for this session. Strictly speaking, then `cml` is not a necessary component for CML but it offers tools to easily get a report about how a specific run performed. If we where just interested in trigging model training everytime we do a `git push` we essentially just need to include
```yaml
run: python train.py
```
to any of our workflow files. 

### Exercises

1. We are first going to revisit our `train.py` script. If we want `cml` to automatically be able to report the performance of
our trained model to us after it is trained, we need to give it some statistics to work with. Below is some psedo-code that computes the accuracy and the confusion matrix of our trained model. Create an copy of your training script (call it `train_cml.py`) and make sure your script is also producing an classification report and confusion matrix as in the pseudo-code.

   ```python
   # assume we have a trained model
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay
   preds, target = [], []
   for batch in train_dataloader:
       x, y = batch
       probs = model(x)
       preds.append(probs.argmax(dim=-1))
       target.append(y.detach())

   target = torch.cat(target, dim=0)
   preds = torch.cat(preds, dim=0)

   report = classification_report(target, preds)
   with open("classification_report.txt", 'w') as outfile:
       outfile.write(report)
   confmat = confusion_matrix(target, preds)
   disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(cm = confmat, )
   plt.savefig('confusion_matrix.png')
   ```

2. Similar to what we have looked at until now, automation happens using *github workflow* files. The main difference from continues integration we have looked on until now, is that we are actually going to *train* our model whenever we do a `git push`. Copy the following code into a new workflow (called `cml.yaml`) and add that file to the folder were you keep your workflow files.

    ```yaml
    name: train-my-model
    on: [push]
    jobs:
      run:
        runs-on: [ubuntu-latest]
        container: docker://iterativeai/cml:0-dvc2-base1  # this contains the continues machine learning pipeline
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v2
            - name: cml_run
              env:
                  REPO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
              run: |
                  pip install -r requirements.txt  # install dependencies
                  python train.py  # run training

                  # send all information to report.md that will be reported to us when the workflow finish
                  cat classification_report.txt >> report.md
                  cml-publish confusion_matrix.png --md >> report.md
                  cml-send-comment report.md

    ```

3. Try pushing the workflow file to your github repository and make sure that it completes. If it does not, you may need to adjust the workflow file slightly.

3. Send yourself a pull-request. I recommend seeing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwyJexAnt9k) very short video on how to send yourself a pull-request with a small change. If you workflow file is executed correctly you should see `github-actions` commenting with a performance report on your PR.

4. (Optional) `cml` is offered by the same people behind `dvc` and it should therefore come as no surprise that these features can interact with each other. If you want to deep dive into this, [here](https://cml.dev/doc/cml-with-dvc) is a great starting point.


# Continues docker building

`cml` integrates well with github and can give a taste of what a continues machine learning pipeline feels like. However, to take our applications
to the next level we are going to look at how we can automatize docker building. As you have already seen docker building can take a couple of minutes
to build each time we do changes to our codebase. For this reason we really just want to build a new image everytime we do a commit of our code. Thus,
it should come as no surprise that we can also automize the building process.


### Exercises

We are for now going to focus on automatizing out training and prediction docker images from session 3. You will most likely need to change the docker image for your training application if it contains your data e.g. you have an `COPY data/ data/` statement in it. Since the github repository does not store our data, we cannot copy it during the build process. We are later going to see how we can pull data during the build process, but this requires us to configure a cloud API storage account which will be part of session 6.

1. Below is an example workflow file for building a docker image. Create one of building your training and one for building
   your prediction docker files. You will need to adjust the file sligtly.
   ```yaml
   name: Create Docker Container

   on: [push]

   jobs:
     mlops-container:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       defaults:
         run:
           working-directory: ./week_6_github_actions
       steps:
         - name: Checkout
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
           with:
             ref: ${{ github.ref }}
         - name: Build container
           run: |
             docker build --tag inference:latest .
   ```
   Explain why it is better to have the two builds in seperated workflow files instead of 1.

2. Push the files to do your github reposatory and make sure the workflow succedes.

3. (Optional) To test that the container works directly in github you can also try to include an additional
   step that actually runs the container.
   ```yaml
     - name: Run container
       run: |
         docker run ...
   ```

Thats ends the session on Continues X. We are going to revisit this topic when we get to deployment, which is the other common factor in classical continues X e.g. CI/CD=continues integration and continues deployment.
