# Continuous X

Continuous X is one of the core elements of modern Devops. Continuous X assumes that we have a (long) developer pipeline 
(see image below) where we want to make some changes to our code e.g:

* Update our training data or data processing
* Update our model architecture
* Something else...

Basically any code change we will expect will have a influence on the final result. The problem with doing changes to the start of our pipeline is that we want the change to propagate all the way through to the end of the pipeline.

This is where *continuous X* comes into play. The word *continuous* here refer to the fact that the pipeline should *continuesly* be updated as we make code changes. You can also choose to think of this as *automatization* of processes. The *X* then covers that the process we need to go through to automatize steps in the pipeline, depends on where we are in the pipeline e.g. the tools needed to do continues integration is different from the tools need to do continues delivery.

In this module we are going though two different continuous X: continues integration and continues machine learning. Both can help us automatize certain processes in our pipeline.
