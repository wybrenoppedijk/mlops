# Scaling applications

This module is all about scaling the applications that we are building. We are here going to use a very narrow definition of *scaling* namely that we want our applications to run faster, however one should note that in general *scaling* is a much broader term. There are many different ways to scale your applications and we are going to look at three of these related to different tasks machine learning algorithms:

* Scaling data loading
* Scaling training
* Scaling inference

We are going to approach the term *scaling* from two different angles that both should result in your application running faster. The first approach is levering multiple devices, such as using multiple CPU cores or parallelizing training across multiple GPUs. The second approach is more analytical, were we are actually going to look at how we can design smaller/faster model architectures that runs faster.

If you manage to complete all modules in this session, feel free to checkout the *extra* module on scalable [hyperparameter optimization](../s10_extra/M27_hyperparameters.md).
